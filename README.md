#### Overview

##### Describe your findings

This is part practice, part exploration. 

I found that I needed the extra practice with the terminal commands and building classes. 

I can create iterable objects of different types, but I ran out of time. 

I had the most time to play with the to_list method and writing tests. 

I have 7 passing tests, but some of them are also basic practice
